## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for every programmer and plays a crucial role in building efficient and scalable software. The goal of this repository is to provide clear explanations and Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms to help you improve your problem-solving skills.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to brush up on your skills, you'll find useful content here to level up your understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

In this section, I will cover various data structures and their Python implementations. Each data structure will have its own folder with well-documented code and explanations.

List of Data Structures covered:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables (Dictionaries)
- Heaps
- and more...

## Algorithms

Here, I will delve into different algorithmic techniques and algorithms used to solve various problems efficiently. You'll find step-by-step explanations and Python code for each algorithm.

List of Algorithms covered:
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth-First Search, etc.)
- and more...
